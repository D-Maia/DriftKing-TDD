# DriftKing-TDD

This is the Technical Design Document that I and my team members made for DriftKing, during pre-production of the project. It specifies the Requirements of the game, which tools we should use and why, lays out the code architecture of its main features, offers charts and mock-ups for the UI screenflow, breaks down the control scheme and target feel of the game in detail.
